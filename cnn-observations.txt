MLP observations:
-Trained with: 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons (Epoch 30 images 60000)
-Accuracy when tested with 10k: 94%

-Trained with 1 hidden layer of 100 neurons Epoch 3 images 60000): 46% accuracy, cost settles down to 0.5

CNN observations:
-using MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons

1) Without CNN filter weight updates:
-Iter 59500 Epoch 3 still hovering over 0.4 range
(if weights aren't updated, then the same FC is always fed into the MLP)

2) With CNN filter weight updates:
-Iter 59500 Epoch 3 is now flucturating around 0.01 - 0.5
(if weights are updated, then the FC fed into the MLP will be different)

-Accuracy when tested with 10k: 17%. After a few epoch cost settles down to 0.5.

More observations:
-iter 2-3 is where the training model seems to be trending downwards
-on every new epoch, for the first 10000+ iters the cost is back up to 0.5-0.6 range again
-for certain tests the cost doesn't even trend down to below 0.1 at all, ths points to the init randomized
values for the filters playing a part

Reason why stuck at 0.5 is because MLP local gradients falls to negative

New test:
-93.0% accuracy on epoch x3: MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons
-93.5% accuracy on epoch x3 CNN of 3 -> 3 filters filter size 13 with MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons
 (CNN filters using same randomize divider as MLP)
-94.3% accuracy for the above if CNN is of 4 -> 4 filters

New test:
-93.0% HIGHEST accuracy on epoch x3: MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons
-94.8% HIGHEST accuracy on epoch x3 CNN of 4 filters filter size 13 with MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons

New test:
-92.5% HIGHEST accuracy on epoch x2: MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons
-93.6% HIGHEST accuracy on epoch x2 CNN of 4 filters filter size 15 with MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons
-92.5% accuracy on epoch x3 CNN of 4 filters filter size 15 with MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons
-94.6% HIGHEST accuracy on epoch x2 CNN of 5 filters filter size 11 with MLP with 1 hidden layer of 20 neurons
-96.9% HIGHEST accuracy on epoch x15 CNN of 5 filters filter size 11 with MLP with 2 hidden layer of 20 neurons

Faster way to test:
-current accuracy while training should be able to accurately show how it's accuracy on the test data will be like
