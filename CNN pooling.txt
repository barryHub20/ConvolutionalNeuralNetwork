CNN pooling layer:
No pooling (bypass layer only): 
-on epoch 3 iter 500 accuracy starts accelerating
-test data results is 97.73%

With pooling: 
-on epoch 9 iter 500 accuracy starts accelerating
-test data results is 91%

Once I fixed the issues with filter and conv backpropagation not using pooling "winning" deltas the issue is resolved, no more stuck on 0.5 accuraccy
